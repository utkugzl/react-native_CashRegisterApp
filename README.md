## About
This cash register app is developed using React Native to create a simple and user-friendly payment system. 
Designed for use by stores, small businesses, or individual users, it enables users to manage their shopping 
transactions quickly and efficiently with its straightforward interface and functionality. Whether adding, 
removing, or editing products, managing shopping carts, handling payment processes, or tracking sales and 
generating reports, this app provides an intuitive solution for businesses or individuals looking to streamline 
their payment operations.

## Configuration and Setup

### Step 1: Install the Dependencies

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

### Step 2: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```


### Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
